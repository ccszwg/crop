crop.sty
========

provides different forms of cropmarks for
trimming paper stacks, for camera alignment and
for visualizing the page dimensions.
There are options for centering the page with
respect to some physical paper size, for marking
the vertical and horizontal middle axis, for
mounting pages on a physical sheet, for
reflecting and inverting the whole document or
printing it upside-down, and for suppressing
either text or graphics output.
